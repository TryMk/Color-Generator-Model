This is a Machine Learning Project (COLOR GENERATOR) whose main purpose is to generate colors in a form of sqaure filled shapes with the input color entered in the form of strings.
The Python Libraries used here are TensorFlow, NumPy and Keras.
One-Hot-Encoding, Character Level Model (Tokenization), Recurrent Neural Networks were the main features used in this model.
