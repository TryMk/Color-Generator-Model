Project Description
The Color Generator Model is designed to generate RGB values for colors based on a dataset containing color names and their RGB values. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for regression tasks.

Installation
To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

TensorFlow
Keras
NumPy
Pandas
You can install the necessary packages using:

bash
Copy code
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas
Usage
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-generator-model.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd color-generator-model
Run the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook "Color Generator Model Final.ipynb"
Load the data:
Make sure the colors.csv file is in the same directory as the notebook.

Execute the notebook cells to train the model and generate colors.
Data
The dataset used in this project is colors.csv, which contains 14,157 color names and their corresponding RGB values.
