## Project Description

The Color Generator Model is designed to generate RGB values for colors based on a dataset containing color names and their RGB values. This project demonstrates the use of deep learning techniques for regression tasks.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas

You can install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/color-generator-model.git
```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd color-generator-model
```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**

```bash
jupyter notebook "Color Generator Model Final.ipynb"
```

4. **Load the data:**

Make sure the `colors.csv` file is in the same directory as the notebook.

5. **Execute the notebook cells to train the model and generate colors.**

## Data

The dataset used in this project is `colors.csv`, which contains 14,157 color names and their corresponding RGB values.
